Problem Statement : 
    Bob is a Research Assistant in the CSE Dept. of NIT Trichy. He is extremely intrigued 
    by arrays. He came across the following problem.
    Bob was given an array of size N. Jenny who is also a Computer Science student asked 
    Bob to answer K queries on the array. Each query is denoted by a pair of indices (X,Y).
    (The array holds 1-based indexing) Bob needs to find how many such numbers are there 
    in a X , a X+1 , a X+2 ,â€¦.,a Y-1 ,a Y such that the number of occurrences of the 
    number is equal to the number itself.
